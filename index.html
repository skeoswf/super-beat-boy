later on a user could upload a sound, and while they upload a sound, ask them to assign a hotkey.

but then id want the user to be able to edit preexisting hotkeys WITHOUT an external ui (eg. "settings"). some way to interact with soundbuttons? what about left + right mouse click to reassign hot keys? 

buttons are click to play as well, right? i think thatd be >> initially << intuitive, but people would be more comfortable using the keys sooner than later. buttt a click of a button that looks like itd play a sound being set to hotkey immediately isnt right. special interaction is best. l+r mouse click to hotkey. escape to cancel. l+m also isnt hotkeyable? i think? who would want to hotkey a sound to l+m? i guess we could make an argument that someone somewhere would want to hotkey some sort of sound in a way that makes sense to combine both inputs on a mouse. but fuck that guy.

BUT l+r is just weird on browsers sometimes man. and what if the fuckin yk right mouse button drop down menu shows up. it definitely will. thatd piss me off. 

what if they hover long enough over a soundbutton, theyd see a text block over or near that button that says [press a key to reassign], and when they click a button (by accident or otherwise) the text says [change sound (or whatever) to '_'? ESC to cancel/ ENTER to confirm]

thats fun i like that. now im wondering if they hover off -- should that text box stay or just leave? we can just feel that one and decide.
