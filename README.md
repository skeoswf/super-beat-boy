## superbeatboy 

more or less planned to be a custom glorified beat pad 

planned features: 
  - users can upload their own sounds to use as beats
  - users can edit their sounds name and hotkey
  - users can archive and true delete sounds

  - users can paste a youtube link, have it converted to an mp3, and it auto splice into separate buttons
    (i kinda want this to be the main shtick but we'll see)
  - users can maybe record their own sounds generated


the following is a quick recording of an alpha build with some features implemented
